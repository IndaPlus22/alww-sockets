sockets

I will go in record to say that this is the worst most gag inducing project that I have built to this day. That being said it does work. Ish

How to:

Cargo run will starts the "server".
You send your message via http://127.0.0.1:7878/.
The client cannot see not receive messages, only the server can.
All messages will show up in the server console.
The program must be shutdown by CTRL-C if you don't somehow break it. Which I imagine can't be all that hard.
